 * Java implementation by Connor Clark (www.hotengames.com). Pretty much a 1:1 
 * translation of a wonderful map generating algorthim by Amit Patel of Red Blob Games,
 * which can be found here (http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/)
 * Hopefully it's of use to someone out there who needed it in Java like I did!
 * 
 * FORTUNE'S ALGORTIHIM
 * 
 * This is a java implementation of an AS3 (Flash) implementation of an algorthim
 * originally created in C++. Pretty much a 1:1 translation from as3 to java, save
 * for some necessary workarounds. Original as3 implementation by Alan Shaw (of nodename)
 * can be found here (https://github.com/nodename/as3delaunay). Original algorthim
 * by Steven Fortune (see lisence for c++ implementation below)

**ATTENTION:** This availability is intended for programmers only. In its current state, the Aether II 1.8.9 rewrite isn't suitable for public use. Things are missing, broken, and subject to major change. Official builds of the Aether rewrite do not currently exist. **Proceed with caution.**

### Submitting Pull Requests
When contributing to the Aether, it is **mandatory** to keep consistent use of the formatting templates found in `code_formatters/`. We will deny pull requests that do not adhere to it.

We hope these templates should be usable for both Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA users alike.

### Setting up your Workspace
Setting up your workspace is identical to any other Forge-based mod environment. At this time, we only support IntelliJ 15 (and newer), sorry Eclipse users.

We make use of _Git submodules_, which don't always get downloaded using the `Download as ZIP` button. If you've cloned using a Git client, make sure you've told it to recursively clone submodules as well.
